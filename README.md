# CNN-Image-Classifier-Tensorflow-Keras-
This repository contains Convolutional Neural Networks that follows steps like Convolution, Max Pooling, Flattening and Full Connection to detect real life pets like dog and cat.

## Installation 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to apply these regression techniques to predict outcome on your dataset you need to have following tools and libraries:
  * Python 2.x or Python 3.x
  * Tensorflow
  * Keras
  * OpenCV (In progress for real time detection)
